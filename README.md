# ProjectTypes-WinFormsMiniProject
The homework from the Lesson 6, Mini Project - WinForms of Module 7, Common Project Types, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a WinForms application with two forms. Create a form that takes in a person's info and another that takes in address info (multiple per person).
